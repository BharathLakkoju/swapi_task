# React + TypeScript + Vite

A web app that presents `StarWars` data using `swapi api` which is integrated to the React application tech stack. This website implements pagination and fetching using api calls. 

#### Get Started

First clone the repo using git or gh command:
```bash
# using git
git clone "https://github.com/bharathlakkoju/swapi_task.git

# using gh
gh repo clone bharathlakkoju/swapi_task
```

Once you clone the repository, you can access all the files and run it on your localhost but before that you need to install all the dependencies:
```bash
# install all the dependencies
# you can use npm, pnpm, yarn or bun
npm install

# run the app
npm run dev
```
